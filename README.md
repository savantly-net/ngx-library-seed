# ngx-library-seed
Seed project for Angular libraries


###To use - 

> Clone this repository into your own workspace, then update the package.json with your project information.  

> Do `npm install` in your project folder to install the dependencies  

> Add your own Angular [typescript] modules, components, services, pipes, and specs to the ./src folder.   
If you install dependencies to the package.json, be sure to exclude them from the bundling by modifying the ./rollup.config.js file.  

> Run `npm test` to test the library.  

> Run `npm run build` to compile, bundle, and minify your library into a umd.  

The resulting minified bundle and intermediate source files will be placed in the ./dist folder with a new generated package.json file; ready for `npm publish`. 


If this project helps you, feel free to buy me a cup of coffee so I can program longer! =]
